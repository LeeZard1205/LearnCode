            Omnifood is just awesome! I just launched a startup which leaves me
            with no time for cooking, so Omnifood is a life-saver. Now that I
            got used to it, I couldn't live without my daily meals! (Alberto
            Duncan) Inexpensive, healthy and great-tasting meals, delivered
            right to my home. We have lots of food delivery here in Lisbon, but
            no one comes even close to Omifood. Me and my family are so in love!
            (Joana Silva) I was looking for a quick and easy food delivery
            service in San Franciso. I tried a lot of them and ended up with
            Omnifood. Best food delivery service in the Bay Area. Keep up the
            great work! (Milton Chapman)
